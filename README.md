## Built With 🛠️
I begun writing this Java application with Spring Java Perspective (Spring Tool Suite) and later with Visual Studio Code because with this I'm writing in other programing languages like nodejs.
Of course you can use your prefer framework or IDE.
* STS – Spring Tool Suite https://spring.io/tools
* VSC- Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/download


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started 🚀

This project contains three files:

1.	**MyProgram.java** – Main program
      * String s contains the name of customer and the money spent in each case.
      * Each customer is inserted in the Heap Structure floating the maximum to the root of tree structure.
      * At the end we get the root of Heap with the Customer Awarded.
  
2.	**MyCustomer.java** – Class MyCustomer 
      * Class with the name of customer and the money spent in our business
  
3.	**Heap.java** – Maximums Heap
      * Tree structure Heap


### Prerequisites 📋
* You can work with your prefer IDE. 


### Installation 🔧
* Deploy the three files into a folder.
